# Callery-Gallery

Intended to be a simple, lightweight gallery and lightbox. That's why it's called callery--because you'll find callery before any calories.

<dl>
  <dt>Simple</dt>
  <dd>Add a few HTML tags and the rest will render for you.</dd>
  <dt>Light</dt>
  <dd>Does not depend on jQuery, well, at least not yet.</dd>
</dl>
